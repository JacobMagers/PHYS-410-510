From the course description:

"Our overall goal for this course is to provide you a framework for how to become more efficient 
at various data management tasks and associated pipeline programming to analyze managed data. While we 
will try to covert and impart some basic skills, mostly we will craft exercises and develop strategies 
for dealing with the myriad of issues that are now part of scientific programming and large data sets."
